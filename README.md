# FakeNewsDetection


We will train a Bidirectional Neural Network and LSTM based deep learning model to detect fake news from a given news corpus. This project could be practically used by any media company to automatically predict whether the circulating news is fake or not. The process could be done automatically without having humans manually review thousands of news related articles.


-Apply python libraries to import and visualize dataset
-Perform exploratory data analysis and plot word-cloud
-Perform text data cleaning such as removing punctuation and stop words
-Understand the concept of tokenizer.
-Perform tokenizing and padding on text corpus to feed the deep learning model.
-Understand the theory and intuition behind Recurrent Neural Networks and LSTM
-Build and train the deep learning model
-Access the performance of the trained model
